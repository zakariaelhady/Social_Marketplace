# Social_Marketplace
This is a mobile app of a social marketplace that helps users to publish their products and interacts with each other.  First I created the web version using laravel / Vue.js / Bootstrap / Mysql and then I used it as a #REST #API for the mobile app created with kotlin &amp;&amp; android studio with the help of Retrofit to fetch data.
